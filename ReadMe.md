  This project aims to provide a detailed analysis of air quality by focusing on various pollutants and gases. The analysis is based on a variety of data sources, including image data representing the dispersion of various pollutants and CSV data files providing information on the presence of various gases.

Getting Started:

  These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites:

The project is implemented using Python and requires the following Python packages:

pandas: A software library for data manipulation and analysis. It offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series.

numpy:
     A library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

matplotlib: 
    A plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy.

PIL (Pillow): 
    An open-source Python Imaging Library that adds image processing capabilities to your Python interpreter.

geopandas: 
    An open-source project to make working with geospatial data in Python easier. It extends the datatypes used by pandas to allow spatial operations on geometric types.

rasterio: 
    A Python library that allows for the reading and writing of geospatial raster data.

shapely: 
    A library for manipulation and analysis of planar geometric objects.

pyproj: 
    A Python interface to PROJ (cartographic projections and coordinate transformations library).

You can install these packages using pip:

    #pip install pandas numpy matplotlib pillow geopandas rasterio shapely pyproj

Clone the repository to your local machine you can clone the repo with git or with the zip file that we provend you 

Running the Scripts:

        The main script to run in this project is main.py. This script performs a variety of tasks, including:

        Downloading images of pollutants from a specified URL.
        Processing the downloaded images, which includes cropping the images and training a model based on these images.
        Downloading and saving pollen data from a specified URL.
        Downloading and merging gas data.
        Processing the gas data to extract useful information.
        Performing image analysis on a specific image, using a GeoJSON file to provide geographic information.
        To run the script, navigate to the directory containing main.py and use the following command:

python main.py


Please note that the actual paths and URLs used in the script are specific to the machine where the script was originally run. Therefore, you'll likely need to adjust these paths and URLs if you're planning to run this script in a different environment.

The scripts will generate a variety of outputs. These include:

    Cropped images that have been processed for analysis.
    Trained models that can be used for further analysis or prediction tasks.
    CSV files that contain data about the presence of various gases and pollen in the air.
    These outputs will be saved to directories specified in the scripts.
